In this page, we will explain how our Anime Recommendation System works based on data from MyAnimeList (MAL). The goal of our project is to help users discover new anime based on their preferences and ratings from other users. The system uses collaborative filtering and text processing techniques to provide personalized and relevant recommendations.
